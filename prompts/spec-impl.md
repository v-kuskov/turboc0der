description: Implement planned spec
argument-hint: [feature slug]
---

Orchestrate implementation for given feature using TDD, subagents and self-verification cycle.

## Pre-flight

1. Read plan `.specs/{feature}/plan.md` — confirm `status: approved`.
2. Explore the codebase enough to understand existing types, interfaces, module structure
and test patterns relevant to the plan.
3. Run verification and tests to confirm clean start.

## Rules

- One task at the time.
- Review-gate per task, do NOT proceed until current task passes review.
- Commit per task, each verified + reviewed task gets one intermediate commit.
- Full test suite at end, run it before merging.
- *Squash all per-task commits collapsed into one consolidated commit.
- Consolidated commit message, describe what was done for the task, follow project's guidlines.
- Never change code, that's what subagents for.

## Create Feature Base Branch

```bash
git checkout -b "feat/{feature}"
```

## Implement plan one task at time

For each task, in execution order:

### Implement

Update the task's frontmatter `status` from `planned` to `in-progress`.
Mark task as `in-progress` in task list.

Launch subagent `tdd-worker` for current task, provide it with:

- Feature slug.
- Path to the task file.
- Paths to referenced spec files.

Agent must implement exactly one task. Wait for agent to complete.

### Review

Launch 2 `reviewer` agents in parallel:

1. Check if code is correct and meets standards and best practices.
2. Check if code does what it's supposed to do against the spec.

Pass to each agent:

- Task description, with all references (spec, plan, task files)
- List of changed files (from `git diff --name-only`)
- Order to use `code-review-excellence` skill.

Review agents must review only changes that were made for current task
with clear context. Wait for review agents to complete, merge results.
Review output is trusted and should not be validated.

### Verify

If review returned any blocking/critical/major issues or verification failed → go to fix loop.

### Fix Loop

When build or test output contains blocking, critical, or major failures:

1. Collect the failure details.
2. Go back to `Implement Task`, re-launch it, add failure details and follow plan from there.
3. Max 2 fix iterations per task.

### Mark Task Done

Update the task `status` from `in-progress` to `done`.

### Commit

```powershell
git add <list of changed files>
git commit -m "<short description what was done>" -m "<list of changes, short explanation what was changed, why if needed>"
```

One commit per task. Follow project-specific commit rules.

### Move to Next Task

Proceed to the next task in the ordered list.

## Full Suite Verification

After ALL tasks are committed run full verification and tests.
If verification fails, fix it.

## Phase 4: Consolidate Feature Branch

```powershell
git checkout master
git pull --rebase                          # catch any upstream changes
git checkout feat/{feature}
git rebase master                          # rebase feature onto latest master
# Verify rebase is clean
<verification and tests>
# Consolidate all intermediate commits into one
$commitCount = git rev-list --count HEAD "^(master)"
if ([int]$commitCount -gt 1) {
    $consolidatedMsg = "- <short description of functional changes that were made with `why` if needed>"
    git reset --soft master
    git commit -m $consolidatedMsg
}
# Verify squash is clean
<verification and tests>
```

## Report

Update project's context.

Return:

- Feature description.
- Tasks implemented and committed (ordered list).
- Per-task: review outcome, fix iterations.
- Squashed commit hash (on feature branch).
- Number of intermediate commits consolidated.
- Any unresolved issues.
