description: Planning implementation for spec
argument-hint: [feature slug]
---

Write implementation plan for created and approved spec.  Take the spec files, validate and sharpen through grilling, deduce what you can from codebase/spec, ask user about the rest. Decompose into a high-level plan with compilable+testable task boundaries.

**Pre-flight**

1. Read project's context, understand it's structure and high-level functionality.
2. Read `.specs/{feature}/spec.md` and all `.specs/{feature}/spec-*.md` sub-specs.
3. Explore the codebase enough to understand existing types, interfaces, module structure
and test patterns relevant to the feature.
4. From the spec and codebase try to resolve each design question yourself.

**1. Spec validation**

- Terminology: does the spec use terms that conflict with CONTEXT.md definitions?
- Boundaries: Are module responsibilities clear? Does the spec imply a dependency direction that conflicts with existing architecture?
- Type shapes: Are the proposed types coherent with existing code patterns?
- Missing assumptions: Does the spec assume capabilities the codebase doesn't have?

**2. Design questions**

- Knowledge barriers, what each piece of code must and must not know, keep it minimal.
- Types, what types feature need, what data and states those types are representing, how connected with another types.
- Interface shape, signatures that match existing patterns, choose simpler over complex.
- Where code must be located, must follow axisting conventions.
- Task decomposition, each task must end with something compilable and testable.

**3. Interrogat the user**

Systematically ask the user about desing decisions that you couldn't resolve. For questions answerable via codebase exploration, explore instead of asking.

Rules:

- Ask ONE question at a time.
- Do NOT ask about user perspective, interrogate about architecture, types, and boundaries.
- If a question is fully answered by exploration, do not ask the user.
- Max 4 iterations, document remaining unknowns as open questions.

Question categories:

1. API shape — "Should Pop return `bool` with out-param, or nullable?" — only if both patterns exist in codebase.
2. Behavioral choices — "When X happens, should we Y or Z?" — only when spec is ambiguous.
3. Config defaults — Any numeric/bool config that needs a default.
4. Error/edge handling — Any non-obvious edge case not covered by spec.

Heuristics:

| Question | How to resolve |
|----------|---------------|
| Where does this type go? | Check existing files for similar types. Follow namespace/package conventions. |
| What signature fits? | Look at existing APIs in the same area. Match conventions (class/interface/fn, params, returns). |
| Which is simpler? | Fewer types, less nesting, no generics when not needed, plain functions vs classes, minimal public API surface. |
| What default? | Check if the codebase uses a similar default elsewhere. |
| How to split tasks? | Find natural seams: data structure → its consumer → wiring. Each task = a vertical slice with its own tests. |

**3. Document decisions**

For each decision, note it with brief rationale. These become part of the plan's Architecture section.

Rules:

- Do NOT ask about WHAT the feature does (spec-write already covered that). Ask only about HOW to build it.
- Every question should offer a recommended answer. "I think X because Y. Does that work?"
- Max 3 iterations.

**4. Plan & Decompose**

Write `plan.md` and `task-{desc}.md` files into `.specs/{feature}/`.

Plan structure:

```markdown
---
status: draft
summary: Execution plan for {feature}
---

# Summary

Brief (2-3 sentences): what gets built, what changes.

## Execution Context

### Runtime/Platform
- Language version, runtime, key packages/frameworks

### Implementation Dependencies
- Libraries, frameworks, internal APIs this depends on

### Constraints
- Must NOT use X. Must stay under Y bytes. etc.

### Validation
- Generic: compile (build succeeds, zero errors), lint (no warnings), test (all pass). Actual commands depend on project language/toolchain.

## Architecture

### Types

For each type (new or modified), describe it's name, what this type repesents, which states it covers.

### Interface

For each new or modified public API, show signatures in pseudocode. Keep minimal — only what's needed to understand the shape.

### Relations

Describe how different parts of the code relate to each other, which types are using and what they're doing.
Describe global state, where and how it changes.

### Boundaries

- What each module knows and does NOT know.
- "X knows Y but not Z."

## Acceptance

Summary of what constitutes success. Reference user stories (US-{N}), functional criteria (FC-{N}), and edge cases (EC-{N}) from the spec.

| Ref | Check |
|-----|-------|
| US-1 | <what the user sees when this is done> |

## File Organization

| Action | File |
|--------|------|
| NEW | path/to/new-file.ext |
| MODIFY | path/to/existing-file.ext — what changes |
| DELETE | path/to/removed-file.ext |

Also list test files.

## Tasks

List of tasks and task files in execution order with short description what those tasks change.

```

Constraints on plan.md:

- ≤ 300 lines total.
- Architecture and high-level only, No implementation pseudocode (1-2 lines of algorithm outline is OK for subtle parts, but no more).
- Focus on types and interfaces.
- Must have `Acceptance` section summarizing user stories, functional criteria, and edge cases from spec.
- File Organization section lists every file touched by the plan.
- Tasks section at the end lists all task files with a short summary and dependency column.

Task file structure:

```markdown
---
summary: One-line description of what this task accomplishes
dependencies: []
---

# Description

2-4 sentences. What this task builds. What it does NOT build (explicit out-of-scope for this task).

## Types

Describes types that need to be changed, added or deleted, keep it short and in pseudocode.

## Interface

API signatures in pseudocode that this task introduces or modifies.

## Implementation

Brief algorithm description. Use pseudocode only for non-obvious logic. ≤20 lines. Omit if logic is straightforward.

## Acceptance criteria

What must pass for this task to be done. Use spec references:

US coverage: which user stories are verified by this task.
FC coverage: which functional requirements.
EC coverage: which edge cases.
Test scenarios: 1-2 sentence descriptions of key test cases (language-agnostic).

## Files to change

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `path/to/file` | NEW / MODIFY / DELETE |

```

Constraints on task files:

- ≤ 300 lines each.
- Keep it short, favor concise descriptions over verbose detail.
- Avoid code, only include pseudocode for genuinely non-obvious algorithms.
- Must have `Acceptance` criteria section, with US/FC/EC coverage and test scenario descriptions.
- Each task must end in a state that compiles and tests pass, reperesent vertical slice: soruce code + tests scoped for this task.
- The first task must have `dependencies: []` — it needs nothing else.
- Follow `dependencies: [task-1, task-3]` format for frontmatter where applicable.
- Dependencies must be acyclic. Tasks form a DAG.

Task decomposition guidelines:

Natural seams that produce compilable+testable boundaries:

1. Pure data structure.
2. Core logic amd it's tests**.
3. Integration wiring.
4. API surface/config.

**5. Validate**

1. plan.md ≤ 300 lines? Count them.
2. plan.md has Architecture/Types section with type focus?
3. plan.md has Tasks table at the end?
4. Each task file follows the template? ≤ N lines (per project norms ~150)?
5. Dependencies form a DAG? No cycles?
6. First task has `dependencies: []`?
7. Each task ends with something compilable and testable? (for this task's scope — compile, lint, test all pass)
8. Task files in same dir as plan.md?

**Post-flight**

1. Update frontmatter `status` to `draft`.
2. Present to user: "Plan written to `.specs/{feature}/plan.md` with X tasks. Review and approve to begin implementation."
