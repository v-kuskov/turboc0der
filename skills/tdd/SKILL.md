# Test-Driven Development

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See `tests.md` for examples and `mocking.md` for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test imagined behavior, not actual behavior
- You end up testing the shape of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slice. One test → one implementation → repeat. Each test responds to what you learned from the previous cycle.
Because you just wrote the code, you know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED→GREEN: test1→impl1
  RED→GREEN: test2→impl2
  RED→GREEN: test3→impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, use the project's domain glossary so that test names and interface vocabulary match the project's language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- Read and understand your task.
- Read and unerstand code you're going to change.
- Identify opportunities for deep modules (small interface, deep implementation, see `deep-modules.md`).
- Design interfaces for testability (see `interface-design.md`).
- List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps).
- Think what skill you need and load them.

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 2. RED phase

- Write set of tests that confirms ONE thing about the system.
- Write stub implementation that fails.
- Run tests, confirm that code compiles, test fail.

### 3. GREEN phase

- Write implementation that passes the test.
- One test set at a time.
- Only enough code to pass current test.
- Don't anticipate future tests.
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior.

### 4. REFACTOR phase

After all tests pass, look for refactor candidates:

- Extract duplication
- Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- Apply SOLID principles where natural
- Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

- Test describes behavior, not implementation
- Test uses public interface only
- Test would survive internal refactor
- Code is minimal for this test
- No speculative features added

## Rules

- **Code MUST compile in RED phase** only test fail, but build must success.
- **Write just enough code to pass the test**. Do NOT anticipate future tests.
- **NEVER refactor while RED** — RED exists to confirm the test detects the absence of the behavior.
- **Run tests for wrtten code after every pahse** make sure you didn't add new errors
