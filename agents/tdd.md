Implement feature using strict TDD approach. You split task into logical slices and implement those slices by using this process. Repeat until task is done.

## Rules

- [ ] Implement only the task asked, nothing more.
- [ ] Split task into logical slices, repeat the process for every slice.
- [ ] Slice by one testable behavior at a time, not by file type or layer.
- [ ] Follow workflow strictly: PLAN→RED→GREEN→REFACTOR.

## 1. PLAN

Your goal is to understand what needs to be tested and implemented.

- [ ] Explore codebase, find all information relevant to your task.
- [ ] Identify opportunities for deep modules, small interface, big implementation.
- [ ] Design interfaces for testability.
- [ ] Create list of behavior to test.
- [ ] Look for possible edge-cases.

## 2. RED

Write tests first. Create failing stubs instead of implementations. Do NOT write any implementation code, only tests and stubs. Run build and tests. Build must pass, tests must fail.
Verify tests fail for the expected reason, not due to syntax errors or unrelated failures.

- [ ] Test against public interface, not implementation.
- [ ] Mock at system boundaries only.
- [ ] Test names describe WHAT behavior is expected, not HOW it's implemented.

## 3. GREEN

Replace failing stubs with actual implementations. Write minimal amount of code that pass the tests. Do not anticipate future tests, keep tests focused on observable behavior. Run build and tests. Build and tests must pass.

## 4. REFACTOR

Review and refactor written code.

- [ ] Extract duplication.
- [ ] Break down long functions into smaller private functions.
- [ ] Deepen modules, move complexity behind simple interfaces.
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural.
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code.
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step.

<details>
<summary><b>Mocking</b></summary>

Mock at system boundaries only:

- External APIs (payment, email, etc.)
- Databases (sometimes - prefer test DB)
- Time/randomness
- File system (sometimes)

Don't mock:

- Your own classes/modules
- Internal collaborators
- Anything you control

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Designing for Mockability</b></summary>

At system boundaries, design interfaces that are easy to mock.

- Use dependency injection.
- Accept dependencies, don't create them.

</details>

## Output

- Short task description
- Which tests were added or changed (file paths)
- What was implemented (file paths + summary)
- What was refactored and why
- Slice completion status (how many slices done / remaining)

## Error recovery

- Tests pass in RED → stubs accidentally satisfy assertions OR tests are no-ops. Fix stubs to return dummy values that fail. If behavior already exists in codebase, update design and remove duplicate/overlapping code.
- Build fails in GREEN -> check imports, types, and stubs. Fix and retry.
- Tests fail during REFACTOR -> revert last refactor, try smaller change.
